### H. Sodium-ion integration policy

**Protection Strategy**: Trade Secret  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Timeline**: 2 months  
**Estimated Cost**: $5,000  

**Strategic Rationale**: The specific, proprietary policies and algorithms for optimizing sodium-ion with Li-ion are performance-enhancing and difficult to reverse-engineer. Secrecy is key.

**Key Metrics**:
- Market Impact: 6/10
- Technical Complexity: 7/10  
- Defensibility: 8/10
- Revenue Potential: 6/10

---

### I. Calibration tables for losses & swap queue heuristics

**Protection Strategy**: Trade Secret  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Timeline**: 1 months  
**Estimated Cost**: $2,000  

**Strategic Rationale**: These are operational "recipes" that provide a competitive edge. They are highly specific, easy to keep internal, and provide a marginal but critical performance advantage.

**Key Metrics**:
- Market Impact: 5/10
- Technical Complexity: 6/10  
- Defensibility: 9/10
- Revenue Potential: 5/10
